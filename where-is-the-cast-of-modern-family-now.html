Nonetheless, her good intentions and ability to own up to her mistakes made her a lovable character. Claire was always putting her family first and would go to great lengths to ensure their happiness.</p><p data-characters=441 data-current-count=778 data-injectable=true>Since Modern Family ended, Bowen has appeared on several TV shows, such as American Dad and Curb Your Enthusiasm. She also starred in a Netflix movie Hubie Halloween with Adam Sandler and other feature films. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a>, Bowen said that Modern Family has given her autonomy over her career since she now has the choice to pursue a project or not. This worked well for the actress since she can spend more time with her kids.</p><h2 id=h-ty-burrell-phil-dunphy data-injectable=false>Ty Burrell (Phil Dunphy)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ty-burrell.jpg><p data-characters=274 data-current-count=574 data-injectable=true>Ty Burrell, who portrayed one of television’s most beloved dads in Phil Dunphy, has turned to voice acting in the animated TV series titled Duncanville.

During his time in Modern Family, he voiced characters in films like The Super Hero Squad Show, The Penguins of Madagascar, and Finding Dory. Burrell has also made cameos in TV shows such as Law & Order, The West Wing, and Back to You.</p><h2 id=h-sarah-hyland-haley-dunphy data-injectable=false>Sarah Hyland (Haley Dunphy)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/sarah-hyland.jpg><p data-characters=389 data-current-count=389 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sarah Hyland</a>‘s character, Haley Dunphy, was the eldest child in the Dunphy family.

She accomplished one major life milestone last August 2022 when she married bachelorette alum Wells Adams.</p><p data-characters=174 data-current-count=563 data-injectable=true>Hyland has also delved into voice acting.

Stonestreet has also stated his interest in a Modern Family spin-off that would portray Cam’s relationship with Mitchell in more depth. While it would make fans of Modern Faimly excited, there haven’t been any signs that the spin-off is being considered.</p><h2 id=h-nolan-gould-luke-dunphy data-injectable=false>Nolan Gould (Luke Dunphy)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/nolan-gould.jpg><p data-characters=429 data-current-count=729 data-injectable=true>Nolan Gould played the lovable and ditzy Luke Dunphy on Modern Family.
