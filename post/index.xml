In the case of the 5800 series this was a particularly long period of time, as TSMC’s production shortage meant that AMD was intentionally shipping out reference cards as fast as humanly possible; and as a result we didn’t see our first custom 5800 series card until 6 months later in February of 2010.</description></item><item><title>Are Method Man and Redman Related?

To many people’s chagrin, the Droid 3 lacks 4G LTE connectivity, instead including dual-mode CDMA2000 1x/EVDO Rev.A and GSM/WCDMA compatibility with a Qualcomm MDM6600. We’ve seen Motorola using the MDM6600 in a host of smartphones lately, and the baseband offers a native dual-mode (world phone) solution that’s essentially fully realized in the Droid 3. To that extent, the Droid 3 does build and improve upon the connectivity of the Droid 2, but still doesn’t offer 4G LTE connectivity which would require an additional baseband and possibly larger package.</description></item><item><title>Channing Tatum Is the Prettiest Unicorn of All Time</title><link>/channing-tatum-is-the-prettiest-unicorn.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/channing-tatum-is-the-prettiest-unicorn.html</guid><description>This weekend, Channing Tatum proved, once and for all, that he is the most impressive unicorn in all the land.
