Their debut album, "Three Imaginary Boys," introduced the world to their unique sound, which became increasingly dark and gothic in the early 1980s. The band's frontman, Robert Smith, is known for his distinctive appearance and evocative songwriting, which often deals with themes of love, loss, and existential angst.<p>Throughout the 1980s, The Cure's music continued to evolve, with Smith experimenting with more pop-oriented songwriting on hits like "Let's Go to Bed," "Just Like Heaven," and "Friday I'm in Love." The band's popularity skyrocketed in the United States, where they charted multiple times on the Billboard Hot 100.</p><p>Over the course of their career, The Cure has released numerous critically acclaimed albums, including "Seventeen Seconds," "Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me," "Wish," "Bloodflowers," and "4:13 Dream." Their music has influenced countless artists across multiple genres and continues to be celebrated by fans around the world.</p><p>With their distinctive sound and poetic lyrics, The Cure has secured their place in the pantheon of rock music. Their enduring legacy is a testament to their talent and the profound impact they have had on the music industry over the past four decades..</p><h2 class=tallist_profile_name>How to hire The Cure for an event</h2><p><b>Learn how to hire The Cure or research availability and pricing for booking The Cure to perform at a corporate event, fundraiser, private party, social media campaign, fair or festival, tradeshow or conference, endorsement project, or hire The Cure as a guest speaker, please submit the form to our agency.</b></p><h2 class=tallist_profile_name>Frequently Asked Questions about booking The Cure to perform.</h2><p>Many performers, actors, speakers and other talent like The Cure in certain cases will consider virtual appearances via live streaming. They perhaps may accept lower fees too. If you are seriously interested in booking The Cure or other talent shown on our site, we will research their desire and the specific fee for your live-streaming event or project request.</p><p>The Cure's current work schedule and location in relation to your event's type, date, budget, and locality will play a primary factor in the acceptance of booking The Cure for your party. As long as your funding is commensurate with the price range to book The Cure, CTI will propose your event to the official agency representing The Cure. After we consult with them, we will provide a personal and accurate quote that includes: final costs, availability, and actual interest in being hired for your specific event or party.</p><p>CTI can give you the accurate The Cure booking price once we submit your event details to their camp. "How much does it cost to book The Cure for an event?" is a frequent question we get. The final The Cure booking price is contingent on many variables and the booking fee we may show is based on a range derived from our past experience with what will The Cure charge for an event. An example fee to book The Cure is in the starting range of $999,999-$1,499,000. However, any recent popularity change would cause a price fluctuation well beyond this example. Also, their speaking fee might be different than the fee shown for the cost to perform or to just appear. Popularity, career stage, along with current demand will cause fluctuations in their speaking price as well. The final booking price may be more than what is shown, but you should at least have a budget within that range for them to consider an appearance, performance or speaking engagement.</p><p>There is low probability to book The Cure for a party with anything substantially less than the published booking cost price range. We will negotiate with the The Cure agent on your behalf if your funding is in place. By not having funding ready then it will more difficult to book The Cure, because they get many offers to work events that are at or above asking price. It is also important to consider the travel costs when researching the The Cure booking fee, as additional expenses like this, as well as an entourage of staff and equipment, are not necessarily built-in to the booking fee range shown. If your budget does not factor that in, then there is no benefit for them to want to be hired. We do not personally speak for The Cure, but in our experience in booking talent for over 25 years, this is generally the outcome of inadequate funding.</p><p><b>Type</b><br>Performer</p><p><b>Style</b><br>Alternative</p><p><b>Range</b><br>Alternative, Pop-80's Music, Male, Age Group-60's+, Age Group-30's-50's, British</p><b>Bookmark and Share</b><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaK4xKerZ6aVqXy0rcypo56skaGyr8CObGxubF%2BptaZ5wq6pnmc%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./john-deere-gx255.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="John Deere GX255 Price, Specs, Reviews &amp;amp; Attachments 2022">&larr;
