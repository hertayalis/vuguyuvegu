You can roast the carrots, cook the carrots in boiling hot water, steam the carrots, and even microwave the carrots. My favorite way to cook carrots is to roast them in the oven. This draws out the natural sweetness in the carrots and the butter and honey gives them the perfect caramelized flavor.&nbsp;</p><p>You can also boil the carrots in a saucepan in boiling water. Once you bring your pot of water to a boil, cook the carrots for about 5-7 minutes or until they are fork tender. Drain and then toss with honey, butter, salt, and fresh lemon zest.</p><p>Another easy method is to microwave the carrots. This is done by placing the carrots and water in a microwave-safe dish and cooking for about 3 minutes. Stir and then cook for another 2 minutes. This should result in tender carrots.</p><p>But the best flavor definitely goes to oven roasted carrots! See below on how to cook carrots in an oven.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Roasted-Carrots-2.jpg alt="These roasted carrots are &nbsp;made with butter, honey, salt, and a touch of fresh lemon zest.

Peel the carrots and slice them or cut them into desired shape. Place on a baking sheet. You can line it with foil for easier clean-up.</li><li>Drizzle with melted butter, honey, and salt. Bake for about 20-30 minutes, or until desired tenderness. Toss the carrots with a spatula, halfway through the baking time, to ensure even baking. Carefully check the carrots with a fork to determine how soft and tender they are. If you prefer a slight crisp in your carrots, I suggest to cook them for about 20 minutes.</li><li>Toss with fresh lemon zest and serve warm. Make sure there is enough salt!</li><p>I hope you love this roasted baked carrots recipe! It is so simple and easy the the perfect side dish for your dinner.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Honey-Glazed-Carrots-1.jpg alt="Honey Butter Glazed Carrots.

I was standing on chairs, tables, stone walls, and whatever I needed to do to capture a beautiful photo.</p><p>What I didn’t know at the time was that there was a magic show going on inside. &nbsp;Since there was floor to ceiling windows in the hotel, they had a perfect view of my crazy antics as I tried to get a good shot. As the magic show ended, lots of people came up to me wondering what in the world I was doing!
