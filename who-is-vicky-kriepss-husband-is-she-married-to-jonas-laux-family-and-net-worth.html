Vicky Krieps is an outstanding Luxembourg actress.</strong></p><p>She has appeared in shows such as Hanna Two Lives, A Most Wanted Man, Colonia Gutland, and The Chambermaid Lynn in the United States, Luxembourg, Germany, and France. It’s tough not to be attracted by the Luxembourgish performer’s never-ending charisma and extravagant performances.</p><p>Since 2008, the attractive woman has been a regular feature in the entertainment industry, having 61 acting credits as of 2022. While information about her professional life is widely available, information about her personal life is rare. Did you know she has two children from her relationship with Jonas Laux? Is it still true that they are together? Let’s meet Vicky Krieps’ husband, children, and way of life.</p><p class=toc_title>Page Contents</p><ul class=toc_list><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">1</span> Is Vicky Kriep Married To Jonas Laux?</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">2</span> Vicky Krieps’ Parents And Family</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">3</span> Vicky Krieps Net Worth</a></li></ul><h2><span id=Is_Vicky_Kriep_Married_To_Jonas_Laux>Is Vicky Kriep Married To Jonas Laux?</span></h2><p>Nope, it doesn’t. Vicky Krieps is not married as of 2023. She was in a relationship with German actor Jonas Laux from 2010 till 2017. Elisa and Jan-Noah, the ex-couple’s children, are stunning. Vicky Krieps and Jonas Laux welcomed their first child, Elisa, in 2011. After a few years, their son Jan-Noah joined the family as the youngest member in 2015.</p><p>There hasn’t been much coverage of Vicky and Jonas’ divorce. However, it appears that the pair divorced in 2017. The Phantom Thread actress is married to Samuel Schneider, according to IMDb. The couple has been dating since 2017 and currently resides in Berlin, Germany. Vicky and her new boyfriend, Samuel, were photographed together in New York in December 2017.</p><p>In September 2018, the pair made their red carpet debut at the 75th Venice International Film Festival. The Krieps-Schneiders have never had children. In December, the pair walked the red carpet at the 2018 European Film Awards in Seville, Spain. Furthermore, the passionate couple is featured on each other’s Instagram account on a regular basis.</p><h2><span id=Vicky_Krieps_Parents_And_Family>Vicky Krieps’ Parents And Family</span></h2><p>Vicky Krieps was born in Luxembourg to a Luxembourgish father and a German mother on October 4, 1983. Bob Krieps, her father, was the manager of a film distribution company. He also served as the General Director of the Luxembourg Ministry of Culture. Bob was also the director of the Luxembourg Film Fund.</p><p>Several of her films were financed by the Luxembourg Film Fund. Furthermore, Vicky Krieps’ grandpa, Robert Krieps, was a politician and member of the Luxembourg Resistance. As a socialist activist in Luxembourg, the star’s grandfather was sent to a Nazi concentration camp.</p><h2><span id=Vicky_Krieps_Net_Worth>Vicky Krieps Net Worth</span></h2><p>Vicky Krieps made her acting debut in 2008. It’s been a decade, and she’s become one of Luxembourg’s most successful actors. Vicky Krieps’ net wealth must be significant. The average yearly pay for an actress in Luxembourg is €87,814 per year, according to ERI. Vicky must be making something close to that.</p><p>Furthermore, Vicky’s films and television shows were great commercial hits. For example, Phantom Thread grossed $47,779,793 at the movie office. Colonia, likewise, grossed more than $3 million at the box office. Given the success of her picture, we may assume that she is well compensated. Vicky Krieps’ personal and professional life is going well despite this. We wish the talented actress further success and happiness.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: M.
