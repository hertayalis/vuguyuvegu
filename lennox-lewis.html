He is widely regarded as the best British boxer of all time. His 2002 battle against Mike Tyson drew a then-record 1.95 million pay-per-view purchases.</p><p>Throughout his career, Lennox made hundreds of millions of dollars in guaranteed purses and, more critically, PPV bonuses. He made almost $50 million from the single Tyson fight alone.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Lennox Lewis?</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Lennox Lewis</a> was born September 2, 1965, in West Ham, London, England. His parents originally came from Jamaica. He weighed more than ten pounds at birth. When he was twelve, he relocated to Ontario, Canada, with his mother. He attended Cameron Heights Collegiate Institute, a public school in Kitchener, Ontario.</p><p>He participated in a variety of sports at school, including Canadian football, soccer, and basketball. When he was thirteen, he decided boxing was his favorite sport, so he started training and rapidly became a successful amateur fighter.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How old is Lennox Lewis?</h2><p>He is currently 58 years old.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Lennox Lewis’s net worth?</h2><p>He is estimated to be worth $140 Million.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Lennox Lewis’s career?</h2><p>He earned a gold medal at the Junior World Championship in 1983, and at the age of 18, he was selected to represent Canada in the Super-Heavyweight division at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. At the time, the International Boxing Association ranked him as the world’s sixth-best heavyweight boxer.</p><p>He made it to the Olympics’ quarterfinals but fell to Tyrell Biggs of the United States, who went on to win the gold medal. Following the Olympics, he decided to continue boxing as an amateur to compete in the 1988 Summer Olympics. He lost to Petar Stoimenov of Bulgaria at the 1986 World Championships, but he won a gold medal later that year at the Commonwealth Games.</p><p>In 1987, he lost by decision at the Pan American Games, with South American judges favoring his Cuban opponent and US judges favoring Lewis. He continued to compete as an amateur, winning numerous more titles before flying to Seoul, South Korea, for the 1988 Summer Olympics. He earned a gold medal for Canada in the super-heavyweight division, becoming the first Canadian boxer to do so in 56 years.</p><p>He returned to England in 1989 to begin his professional boxing career. He signed with boxing promoter Frank Maloney and went undefeated in his first twenty-two professional matches. He soon ascended through the ranks, and in 1992, he agreed to face Donovan “Razor” Ruddock, with the winner going on to fight either Riddick Bowe or Evander Holyfield.</p><p>Bowe defeated reigning champion Holyfield, while Lewis knocked off Ruddock in the second round. Rather than defend his championship against Lewis, Bowe vacated it, and Lewis was awarded the World Boxing Championship title in December 1992. He was the twentieth century’s first British world heavyweight champion. He has successfully defended his championship three times.</p><p>In September 1994, he lost it in a contentious battle that the referee ruled a technical knockout. Lewis rose up by the count of six, but staggered forward, and the referee declared him unable to continue. After losing his belt, Lewis engaged famous boxing trainer Emmanuel Steward to replace his previous trainer, Pepe Correa.</p><p>A comeback battle between Lewis and Lionel Butler was scheduled to provide Lewis the chance to reclaim his title if he won, but when he did, the World Boxing Commission opted to give Mike Tyson the opportunity instead. Tyson won the championship, and Lewis later sued to force him to defend it.</p><p>The action was settled, and Tyson defended his title against Bruce Seldon before relinquishing it. Leaving the WBC belt vacant paved the way for Lewis and McCall’s return battle in Las Vegas in February 1997. Lewis won when McCall started crying and refused to continue after the third round.</p><p>In 1998, he challenged World Boxing Association and International Boxing Federation titleholder Evander Holyfield, but the bout was controversially deemed a draw. A rematch was organized eight months later, and the judges unanimously declared him the winner, establishing him as the undisputed heavyweight champion.</p><p>In 2002, he successfully defended his title against Mike Tyson. Lewis retired in 2004 with 41 victories, 2 losses, and 1 draw.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqWcp6afrXqtsdaiqmg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./derek-deso-net-worth-2024.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Derek Deso Net Worth 2024">&larr;
