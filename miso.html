I‚Äôve had this cauliflower soup recipe in my cold weather rotation for years now. Even though all the ingredients are plant-based, it‚Äôs just as comforting as any soup made with heavy cream, milk, or cheese. On a chilly winter night, it absolutely hits the spot! It‚Äôs also super simple to make, so there‚Äôs lots to love here. Cauliflower Soup Ingredients You only need 10 basic ingredients to make this creamy cauliflower soup: A head of‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This Asian slaw recipe falls into my favorite category of food: summer salads! Colorful, juicy, crunchy, sweet, bitter, herby, spicy‚Ä¶ there are so many flavors and textures to put together with all of the great fruits and vegetables that are in season right now. I love a good salad all year round, but the summer salad will always have my heart. This Asian slaw recipe is a fantastic example of the summer salad‚Äôs potential. It takes under 30 minutes to make, and it‚Äôs jam-packed with contrasting textures and flavors. It‚Äôd be a perfect side dish for a cookout, but it‚Äôs‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Happy Sunday! If you need one more recipe idea to make for your weekend celebrations, give this grilled potato salad a try! When I say the words ‚Äúpotato salad,‚Äù my mind can only think of the kind that is laden with mayonnaise‚Ä¶ which, admittedly, I will eat and enjoy once in a blue moon, but I love this one SO much more. By using par-boiled and then grilled potatoes, you get to taste the wonderful char-ry taste of the actual potato and not just a bunch of mayo.

With summer on the horizon, at least in my still-Austin-based mindset, I really want to be making lighter and brighter food. But then I‚Äôm reminded that it still snowed here last week. Sooooo‚Ä¶ a creamy pasta bake it is! This veggie-ful dish is hearty yet cheese-less ‚Äì it won‚Äôt weigh you down, but it will fill you up! Instead of a bunch of cheese and cream, I used my secret creamy blender sauce: almonds, Almond Breeze almondmilk, white miso paste, garlic, lemon juice for tang, and a bit of Dijon mustard for the depth you‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Happy Monday, it‚Äôs pasta time! This is a spin on a recipe that has been a reader favorite (also one of my favorites) from our&nbsp;cookbook.&nbsp;In the book, this creamy miso pasta is made with brussels sprouts&nbsp;‚Äì have you tried it? If so, you‚Äôre going to love this version&nbsp;with shiitake mushrooms and kale. If you haven‚Äôt tried it, well&nbsp;now‚Äôs your chance üôÇ The cashew cream has just 5&nbsp;ingredients: cashews, miso paste, garlic, lemon, and black pepper. It‚Äôs so simple to make, yet it‚Äôs so hearty and delicious ‚Äì especially&nbsp;with saut√©ed shiitake mushrooms. Shiitakes have such a wonderful umami flavor ‚Äì I‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Last summer, I had a&nbsp;lucky opportunity to spend a&nbsp;few weeks in France&nbsp;visiting vineyards, tasting wine, and of course eating great food. Whenever I travel, I come back with a list of recipes that I might want to recreate. Very often, the ones I actually end up making in my kitchen‚Ä¶ the ones that stand out in my memory the most‚Ä¶ are the simplest. My Zucchini Soup Recipe Inspiration Jack met me toward the end of the&nbsp;trip, which left me with some time alone in Paris&nbsp;while waiting for his flight to arrive. I knew exactly how to spend the day&nbsp;‚Äì I‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>There‚Äôs nothing better than having a vibrant salad dressing on hand in the fridge during a busy work week. When you‚Äôre strapped for time, a yummy sauce can make even the simplest meal feel satisfying. Lately, whipping up this citrus miso dressing has been my go-to. It‚Äôs a bright,&nbsp;tangy combination of clementine, lemon, miso, garlic, and ginger.&nbsp;In addition to tasting delicious, all of these ingredients have detoxifying properties&nbsp;‚Äì so consider this dressing a little health kick too! How to Use Miso Dressing Once you make this miso salad dressing, you‚Äôll use it on everything. Not sure where to start?

Which isn‚Äôt normally the way I work, but I knew this humble healthy&nbsp;soup would get little love in between all of the sparkly &&nbsp;sprinkle-y holiday recipe madness. So I saved it especially for this week, which is otherwise known as the soupiest, salad-iest week on the internet. Inspired by our love of Japanese cooking, this recipe is nourishing, light, and refreshing ‚Äì perfect for a winter reset.

First, we never think ahead to actually make reservations, and then (way too often) we find ourselves waiting 2 hours on a Friday night for a meal. Some people might be ok with that, but this girl gets hungry. Gyoza (Japanese dumplings) are one of our favorite things to make together at home. They‚Äôre not difficult but they take a little time ‚Äì the assembly is definitely quicker if you have 4 hands and a bottle of sake on the side. We often eat these as a light‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>They say to feed a cold right? I don‚Äôt get sick very often, but this week I‚Äôve been a little bit down for the count. It‚Äôs not the worse thing ever ‚Äì it‚Äôs just lingering‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôs also hungry.&nbsp;Lately, I‚Äôve been craving foods that are hot, cold, and, well, salty (you know, so I can actually taste things). My scratchy throat and I were on Pinterest&nbsp;the other day and&nbsp;we were inspired by&nbsp;this&nbsp;soup and also&nbsp;this&nbsp;one. I read somewhere that garlic, lemon, and steam help to cure coughs and colds so this broth-y soup fit the bill.

It‚Äôs not exactly balmy here, but it‚Äôs a far cry from the -11 degrees my weather widgets (and text message updates from my mom) are showing for tomorrow‚Äôs Chicago‚Äôs forecast. Yikes‚Ä¶ This soup is full of warming healing ingredients (shiitakes, ginger, miso, etc.)‚Ä¶ and would be the perfect thing if you‚Äôre under the weather, figuratively or quite literally. If you need more soup recipe ideas, try this ginger miso soup, this many-veggie soup, or this vegan tomato soup!</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbvVnpinnJyaurC60meaqKVfqa6oe8yiqqhn</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./christo-and-jeanne-claude-net-worth-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Christo and Jeanne-Claude Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?">&larr;
