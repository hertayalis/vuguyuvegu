He acknowledged spending nearly two years of his boyhood playing Clash Royale professionally. His initial interest in video games stemmed from his experience with Call of Duty: Black Ops 2.</p><p>It was the game that brought his love of video gaming to life. He watched Ninja, Tfue, Nick Mercs, and other well-known Twitch streamers while Fortnite was consuming all other video games. However, Daequan Loco and Hamlinz gave him the idea to launch his channel.</p><p>He started his channel in January 2019 and streamed the game for almost a year. Unfortunately, we couldn’t draw any audience, so we had to switch to NBA 2K. Even though he was only getting a few thousand views when he started broadcasting Rainbow Six Siege, his career took off. In the early days of his RSS broadcasting, he became aware of the number of concurrent viewers approaching double digits in real-time. Because he is funny and good at the game, his streams soon became popular.</p><p>Although he just spent a few hundred hours streaming the NBA 2K series, he has already racked up over 6,000 hours of RSS streaming. With 66k concurrent viewers, his match against fellow Twitch streamer Beaulo turned into his most-watched stream to date.</p><p>When he actively garnered 1,000 concurrent viewers in 2021, his career took off. Through 2022, growth is anticipated to stay moderate. In the first three months of 2023, however, his channel’s growth more than doubled.</p><p>As of right now, he has over 911k followers.
