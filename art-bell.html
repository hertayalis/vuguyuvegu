It was broadcast on over 500 stations and over 15 million people tuned in to hear it.</p><p>Art Bell established credibility through hosting live question-and-answer sessions on his show. He honed the skill of patiently listening and then responding objectively. Art Bell only screened questions once, in October 2006, when he broadcasted from the Philippines. He spoke with singers, authors, actors, DJs, and comedians, among others. Over the course of his illustrious career, he interviewed notable figures such as Willie Nelson, Merle Haggard, Greg Bear, Chris Carter, Dan Aykroyd, Casey Kasem, and George Carlin. His talks were well-received because they were laid-back while still covering significant and topical topics.</p><h2><span id=Body_Measurements_Height_Weight_Hair_color>Body Measurements: Height, Weight, Hair color</span></h2><p>Art has brown eyes and white hair.
